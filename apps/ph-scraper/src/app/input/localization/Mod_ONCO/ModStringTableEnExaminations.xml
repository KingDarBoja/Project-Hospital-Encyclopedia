			<Text>There is currently no effective screening test for ovarian cancer. When a patient is suspected to have ovarian cancer the doctor will perform various tests to find any abnormalities that need to be followed up with a biopsy. The only way to confirm a diagnosis of ovarian cancer is by taking a tissue sample (biopsy) and looking at the cells under a microscope. \n\nRequired Lab: Histology</Text>

			<Text>Certain signs and symptoms may strongly suggest vaginal cancer, but many of them can be caused by other problems. The only way to be certain that it's cancer is to do a biopsy. In this procedure, a small piece of tissue from the suspicious area is removed. A technician specializing in diagnosing diseases with lab tests (Histology Lab Technician) will then look at the tissue sample under a microscope to see if cancer or a pre-cancerous condition is present and, if so, what type it is. \n\nRequired Lab: Histology</Text>
