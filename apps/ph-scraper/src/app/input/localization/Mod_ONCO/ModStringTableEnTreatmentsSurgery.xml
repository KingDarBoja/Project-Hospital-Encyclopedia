	<Text>Nerve Reconstructive Surgery, or surgical nerve repair involves exploration of the injured nerve and removal of injured tissue or scar from the nerve endings.

	<Text>Splenectomy is a surgical procedure to remove your spleen. The spleen is an organ that sits under your rib cage on the upper left side of your abdomen. It helps fight infection and filters unneeded material, such as old or damaged blood cells, from your blood. The most common reason for splenectomy is to treat a ruptured spleen, which is often caused by an abdominal injury. Splenectomy may be used to treat other conditions, including an enlarged spleen that is causing discomfort (splenomegaly), some blood disorders, certain cancers, infection, and noncancerous cysts or tumors. \n\nRequired room: Operating room at Oncology dpt.</Text>

	<Text>Brachytherapy is a procedure that involves placing radioactive material inside the patient's body. Brachytherapy is one type of radiation therapy that's used to treat cancer. Brachytherapy is sometimes called internal radiation. Brachytherapy allows doctors to deliver higher doses of radiation to more-specific areas of the body, compared with the conventional form of radiation therapy (external beam radiation) that projects radiation from a machine outside of your body. Brachytherapy may cause fewer side effects than does external beam radiation, and the overall treatment time is usually shorter. \n\nRequired room: Operating room at Oncology dpt.</Text>
